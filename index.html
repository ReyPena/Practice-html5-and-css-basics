		<h3>CSS</h3>
		<p>
			Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language. While most often used to change the style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.

		<h3>Html</h3>

			HyperText Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like open and close, although some tags represent empty elements and so are unpaired. The first tag in a pair is the start tag, and the second tag is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).
